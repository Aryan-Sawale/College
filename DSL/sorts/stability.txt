Several common sorting algorithms are stable by nature, 
such as Merge Sort, Timsort, Counting Sort, Insertion Sort,
and Bubble Sort. Others such as Quicksort, Heapsort and Selection Sort
are unstable.

We can modify unstable sorting algorithms to be stable.
For instance, we can use extra space to maintain stability in Quicksort.
